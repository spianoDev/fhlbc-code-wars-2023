# At the top of the file is some starter code that randomly picks a number between 1 and 10,
# and saves it to a variable called choice.  Don't touch those lines! (please)
#
# Your job is to write a simple conditional to check if choice  is 7.  If choice  is 7, print out "lucky".
# Otherwise, print out "unlucky".

# NO TOUCHING PLEASE---------------
from random import randint
choice = randint(1, 10)
# NO TOUCHING PLEASE---------------

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE:
if choice == 7:
    print(f'lucky number {choice}')
else:
    print(f'unlucky {choice}, try again')
